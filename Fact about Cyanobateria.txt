Fact about Cyanobateria:
- 1 kg of Cyanobacteria (a type of phytoplankton) can consume 1.83 kg of CO2 in ideal conditions [1].
- A mature tree will capture about 22 kg of CO2 per a year [2]. Cutting down a tree will add extra 22kg of atmospheric CO2, demanding extra 12 kg of Cyanobacteria to compensate this.
- A Tesla would produce 0.066 kg of CO2 per km [3]. The average EU citizen travelled 27 km per day [4], meaning that 1.782 kg of CO2 will be produced if that person uses a Tesla per day, demanding 0.97 kg of Cyanobacteria to compensate.
